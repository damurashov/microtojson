# microtojson

A simple embedded friendly JSON serializer.

This is still beta, use at own risk.

Make sure structs are NULL terminated.

Currently only string and integer are valid types.

See `test_mtojson.c` for usage.

This project is heavily inspired by microjson from Eric S. Raymond (https://gitlab.com/esr/microjson/).
